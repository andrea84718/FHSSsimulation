# FHSSsimulation
This project aims to overview different attacks against the remote keyless-entry (RKE) system, using a MATLAB GUI to simulate the theme of RFID relay attacks by different variables to illustrate and compare the outputs in the beginning of the design, propose a security solution to prevent relay attack by vehicle and key communicate via frequency hopping, and to verify this new idea can indeed im- prove the automotive security.

#### Suppose
* Distance between car and key is 100m.
* Vehicle and key using frequency- hopping for identification.
* The thieves also using frequency- hopping to catch the signal.

#### Tag
* X, Y mean the thiefâ€™s position.

#### Hopping Rate
* Level means the hopping rate that thief should at least faster then.
